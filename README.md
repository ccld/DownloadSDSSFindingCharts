`sdssDR9findingChart.py` is a script that allows you to automatically download finding charts from Data Release 9 (DR9) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

It has been written without using the [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/ "Requests: HTTP for Humans &mdash; Requests 1.1.0 documentation") module so that it can be run without having the users install additional dependencies.

Usage
=====

You invoke the tool with

    sdssDR9findingChart.py fileWithAstroObjects

where `fileWithAstroObjects` is a text file containing an astronomical source name per line. Non-valid names are ignored.

The result is a finding chart from SDSS DR9 as a JPEG file which is downloaded in the directory from which the `sdssDR9findingChart.py` script is called.

Installation
============

1. Download `sdssDR9findingChart.py`
2. `chmod +x sdssDR9findingChart.py`, to make it executable
3. Move it to a place in your PATH

Optionally, you can download the `object.txt` file (for instance, to `~/Downloads`), and test the script with

    sdssDR9findingChart.py ~/Downloads/objects.txt

The expected output will look like:

Configuration
=============

Right now, the only configuration capabilities imply editing the script and manually modifying the `sdssParamsDict` dictionary.

For more information on which options are valid, see http://skyserver.sdss3.org/dr9/en/tools/chart/chart.asp

To do
=====

* Add help to the script
* Add configuration options corresponding to the chart using 
* Create `setup.py` script so that it can be installed in a user prefix
